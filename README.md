# Vending-Machine-GUI
Modified Vending machine GUI using Yamaha sound chips from Brendan McBride.

This program simulates a vending machine controlled by a Raspberry Pi400 using PySimpleGUI for the graphical user interface (GUI) and gpiozero for a servo motor and a return change button. The program simulates a basic vending machine's functionality, handling coin insertion, product selection, and change return.

Prices are based on the capabilities of each chip and are not accurate to real life Yamaha sound chips.
